# gstreamer_plugin_code
GStreamer code that shows how to create a basic filter.  

This code implements a basic filter pulled from the GStreamer GstVideoFrame documentation that has many errors in it.  I was left confused and pissed, 
so I spent a few hours walking through the code and got something working.  I hope it can help you as well.  

cheers.
